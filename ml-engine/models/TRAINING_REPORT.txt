ML MODEL TRAINING REPORT
================================================================================

Model: Isolation Forest
Training Date: 2025-11-14 16:47:55

Dataset Information:
  - Training samples (normal only): 6,358
  - Test samples: 2,000
  - Features: 13
  - Contamination parameter: 0.21

Model Performance:
  - Accuracy:  75.45%
  - Precision: 43.37%
  - Recall:    64.63%
  - F1-Score:  51.91%

Confusion Matrix:
  - True Negatives:  1,244
  - False Positives: 346 (21.76%)
  - False Negatives: 145 (35.37%)
  - True Positives:  265

Verdict:
  FAIR! Consider feature engineering or more data.
  High false positives - may need threshold tuning.

Models Saved:
  - models/isolation_forest.pkl (main model)
  - models/kmeans.pkl (clustering support)
  - models/scaler.pkl (feature scaling)
  - models/metrics.pkl (performance metrics)

Next Steps:
  1. Build FastAPI ML service
  2. Test with real-time data
  3. Deploy to production
  4. Monitor performance
